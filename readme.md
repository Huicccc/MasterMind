## About
  Mastermind is a coding-breaking board game. The “secret code” is a set of 4 colors chosen out of a possible 6 colors, where the player needs to guess which colors are in which positions in the 4-color secret code. After each guess, the player learns how many colors in their guess are in the right position, and how many had a color that’s in the code but the color is in the wrong position. Scoring pegs of different colors were used to show them how many correct guesses and how many correct positions they had gotten with their guess. Red pegs meant a correct color but out of position, black pegs meant a correct color in the correct position. These scoring pegs after each guess can be placed in any order – the player never knows which colors are correct and/or in the correct position. </br>
  In an older version of Mastermind, called, Bulls and Cows, guesses with correct position were called “bulls”, and correct guesses with incorrect positions were called “cows”. We will use the “bull” and “cow” terminology when talking about correct guesses for Mastermind.
